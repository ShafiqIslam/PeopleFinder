1. Find app/Locale/default.pot
   This is the template file of transation. It contains all the sentences used in the project.
2. Download PoEdit from https://poedit.net/.
3. Using this software you can translate to any of your desired language. Translate the sentences.
4. Save the file in /app/Locale/{language-short-code}/LC_MESSAGES/default.po
   ex: app/Locale/ben/LC_MESSAGES/default.po for Bengali (We've done that for you).
5. Open app/Config/global.php
	Add your language to $config['availableLanguages'] array in this format '{language-short-code}' => 'Language Name'

	Example:
	Initially the array contains two languages. And looks like this:
		$config['availableLanguages'] = array(
			'eng' => 'English',
			'ben' => 'Bengali'
		);
	If you want to add Spanish in your list, then the array will be:
		$config['availableLanguages'] = array(
			'eng' => 'English',
			'ben' => 'Bengali',
			'spa' => 'Spanish'
		);
6. You can also change the default language. For that, change $config['defaultLanguage'] = '{language-short-code}';
7. Everything should be ok. If not, delete all the tmp files from /app/tmp/cache/persistent/*.* . Anyway, working fine, or not, delete the files (if any).


Important:
==========
Try to follow ISO 639-3 standard for language codes. I'll encourage to strictly follow it. You can find a list here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-3_codes

And Remember, the {language-short-code} on the array must be same as {language-short-code} folder name in Locale directory.
